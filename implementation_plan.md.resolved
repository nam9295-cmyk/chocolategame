# Chocolate Bunny Game Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Create a cute web browser game where a rabbit catches chocolates falling with parachutes. The rabbit grows larger as it eats more chocolate.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Structure
- `index.html`: Game container and UI overlay.
- `style.css`: Styling for the game, bunny, parachute, and background.
- `script.js`: Game logic loop, event listeners, and object management.

### Mechanics
1.  **Rabbit**:
    -   Located at the bottom of the screen.
    -   Controlled via mouse move or touch (drag).
    -   Visual: Cute white/pink rabbit (SVG or CSS).
2.  **Chocolate with Parachute**:
    -   Spawns at random x positions at the top.
    -   Falls slowly (simulating parachute).
    -   Visual: Brown chocolate bar/piece attached to a colorful parachute (SVG/CSS).
3.  **Collision & Growth**:
    -   When chocolate touches the rabbit, it disappears.
    -   Rabbit scale increases slightly (clamped to a max size to avoid breaking screen).
    -   Score/Count display.

### Visuals
-   **Background**: Sky blue with clouds, grassy bottom.
-   **Style**: Cartoonish, pastel colors, "cute" aesthetic.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
-   Open `index.html` in browser.
-   Verify rabbit moves with mouse.
-   Verify chocolates spawn and fall.
-   Verify rabbit grows when catching chocolate.
-   Check game over or win condition (if any) or endless mode.
